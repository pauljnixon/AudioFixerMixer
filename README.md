# AudioFixerMixer / MusicVol

Allows you to turn up or down the volume of just one Android audio stream.  

But the interface to pick which audio stream you want to adjust the audio for, is awkward, which is why most Android mixers don't even give you the option.  

The recommended way to do this is for each app to include the ability to adjust its own audio volume.  Lately most apps have started to do this (including the two I originally cared about, Google Maps and Google Play Music).  

So, this project is essentially obsolete even though it never was really polished enough to be useful.  It was a good learning exercise though.  Android's system for threads is definitely a lot better than its system for audio.
